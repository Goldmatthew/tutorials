## **Internship:**
The information contained at [this link](https://www.psicologia.unipd.it/en/training-and-stages-0) provide all the information that are necessary to start the internship.
Relative to the date and time, it is not easy to define them in advance. For this reason, it is sufficient fill the form with approximate date and time, that will not be the actual ones.
To do this, it is necessary considering the overall hours that are necessary to complete the internship. For example, assuming that your internship can be officially concluded after 200 hours, you could indicate three weekday, four hour each, seventeen weeks (3 * 4 * 17 = 204). When you do this calculation, do not forget to exlude holydays.

## **Graduation:**
[This link](https://www.psicologia.unipd.it/en/final-dissertation-and-thesis-submission) provide all the necessary information.
It is extremely important to do as soon as possible the request of the thesis supervisor (in italian: "Domanda di relatore"), otherwise other students could "steal" your own slot as near-graduate. The instruction for this request can  be found [here](), that is a page that can also be reached from the more general page linked here above.
In past there were only few short time window to make the formal request of a thesis supervisor, but presently the rules of the School of Psychology are changed and it seems that it is possible to do this request basically at every time. It is not clear why the english page say that this procedure will start on March. Given that my unipd account is not a student account I cannot check, but I suggest to try to do the request anyway (in case that something will go wrong email me and maybe we can try to email to the Psychology School's administration).

## **Laboratories**
To be allowed to use a laboratory (and to have autonomous to it) it is necessary filling [this form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pz3bx67vcs2nlr8/0-Scheda-di-accesso-ai-corsi-per-i-frequentatori-dei-laboratori.pdf?dl=0) and [this other](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t08uk8jiw5071rt/Modello-richiesta-pass-con-Microntel-vers-11_2019.pdf?dl=0). Given that it was possible, I have already filled partially the first one. The second one is not updated, and there are some fields which are quite meaningless. The important thing is to mark "DPSS" at the session "Struttura richiedente" (DPSS is our department, and "struttura richiedente" means something like "applying organization"), then "Gruppo LAB DPSS" in the section "Gruppo di appartenenza" and then "LAB Elettroencefalografia" in the section "Laboratorio". 
As dates (bottom part of the page) I suggest to select the conclusion date later than the official internship (let's say a date near to the expected graduation date, so you will be autonomous to get access to the lab for any need).
Once you fill and sign the forms, email them to me (also attaching the certificate of the safety course that you do to start the internship).
