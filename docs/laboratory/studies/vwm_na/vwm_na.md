In a [recent paper](Feldmann-Wustefeld-Psychphys-2020.pdf) a new experimental design to investigate visual working memory with EEG has been proposed. In past, in all the experimental design about visual working memory the participants were asked to maintain in memory a variable numer of items (e.g., colored squares) presented on the left or on the right of fixation. In this new proposal participants are asked to memorize both the left and the right side of the memory array. Importantly, the author proposed that participants encoded information preferably from the hemifield with a smaller number of items.
