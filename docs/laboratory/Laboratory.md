### Preparing the lab <a name="preparing"></a>
###### [(Back to top)](#toc)

- Behind the lab's door you find this switch. You can turn to the red size to turn on the "Laboratory in use" indication outside the lab (hoping that nobity will bother you during testing).

- fill two syringes (about a half) with SuperVisc gel without the needles (we usually put the needle in front of the participant to prove that we use them only once). We usually cover the syringes with some paper to avoid participants' anxious reactions.
- put a bit of Nuprep (scrub) gel inside the green cup.
- put the informed consent and a pen on the desk where participant will perform the experiment.
- take the electrodes (reference and ground also) and put the adhesive discs where necessary.
- Be sure that you have all the necessary to do the montage (e.g., where is the measuring tape?).
- Put some paper towel/blotting paper or something similar on the sink that participant will use after the experiment to clean the gel.

### Montage <a name="montage"></a>
###### [(Back to top)](#toc)

- Scrub below the left eye, near to the external canthi considering that the electrodes will be placed aligned to the pupils.
- Scrub the earlobes.
- Put the cap.
- Move the hair with the needle, put some gel, and then move the hair again if necessary. Remember that we say to participants that we are only moving the hair, but we are also doing a little scrub with the needle (that is necessary to reduce impedence).
- Put the scalp electrodes first, and then the external ones (eyes' and earlobes' electrodes).

### Set the harware connections <a name="hardware"></a>
###### [(Back to top)](#toc)

- Unplug the battery by unplagging the blue plug on the top (it can only give electricity to amplifiers if it is not charging).

- Turn on the amplifiers with the switches behind them.

- Plug the electrodes to the control box (see picture below). If you are doing a 32 channels montage plug them to the green slot, if you are doing a 64 channels you should plugged the first 32 electrodes (placed in the green placeholders of the cap) in the green slot, and the other 32 electrodes (yellow placeholders) in the yellow slot.

The right way to plug them is to match the triangle on the plug with the triangle on the slot (see picture below). Softly push the plug to insert in.

Now, plug the Ref (Reference) and Gnd (Ground) electrode to their respective slot. There is a small cut on both the plugs that will help you to insert them in the right way.

The stanby button on the control box should be already turned on. Otherwise, turn it on by pressing it few seconds.

### Softwares <a name="softwares"></a>
